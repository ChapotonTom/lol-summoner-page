The technology used for this project is **ReactJS**, as the goal was to set it up and start coding quickly and efficiently.

For those same reasons, it didn't need to be developed in **Typescript**, **Javascript** only was sufficient for this project.

As the visual part of this project was also important, the **Bulma** CSS library was used as it offers convenient tools for building responsive web interfaces.

HTTP calls were made through the **Axios** library.
